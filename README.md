# v4l2-list-devices

A single C++ header file containing a single function to list USB camera devices on linux using V4L2 and ioctl.

## TL; DR;

Copy file `include/list_devices.hpp` to your project and use it:

```c++
#include "list_devices.hpp"

std::vector<v4l2::devices::DEVICE_INFO> devices;
v4l2::devices::list(devices);
```

## But why?

This function provides a way to list devices without brute force probing the system.

In addition, and maybe more important, the resulting data contain USB bus port identification which is useful to properly identify the right camera if you have more than one attached to the computer.

## how to use

- Copy `include/list_devices.hpp` to your project's include folder
- Include the header with `#include "list_devices.hpp"`
- call `v4l2::devices::list(devices)`
- v√≤i la!

Note that this repo contains a CMakeLists.txt file which is useful only for build the usage example. It is noteworthy that you needn't build nothing in order to use the header `list_devices.hpp` in your projects! Duh!

## Example

This is basically the contents of file `main.cpp` 

```c++
#include <iostream>

#include "list_devices.hpp"

int main() {

    std::vector<v4l2::devices::DEVICE_INFO> devices;

    v4l2::devices::list(devices);

    for (const auto & device : devices) 
    {
    
        std::cout << device.device_description <<  " at " << device.bus_info << " is attached to\n";

        for (const auto & path : device.device_paths) {
            std::cout << path << "\n";
        }
        
    }

}
```

# C++ 17

`list_devices.hpp` uses features from c++17. I'm a little tired right now to downgrade it to C++11. Let me know if you need it to run on a C++11 settings and I'll find time to fix it for you!

## Credits

This code is based on the `list_devices()` function from [v4l2-ctl](https://github.com/gjasny/v4l-utils/blob/master/utils/v4l2-ctl/v4l2-ctl-common.cpp#L232).
